# 🧠 Mindreader.ai – "Can AI Read Your Mind?"

[cite_start]**Mindreader.ai** is an immersive, interactive AI experience developed for the **Night of the Nerds** event[cite: 4]. [cite_start]This project deconstructs the myth of "magical" artificial intelligence and transforms it into a transparent, fascinating educational tool[cite: 5, 79].

A visitor thinks of any object, and our system attempts to guess it within **a few insightful questions**. [cite_start]It’s not mind-reading – it’s the pure power of data logic and probability in action[cite: 4, 5].

## 🚀 Technical Evolution: From Cloud to Open Source
This project serves as a testament to our technical flexibility and ability to pivot when facing real-world challenges:
* [cite_start]**Phase 1 (OpenAI API):** Initially, the system was built using OpenAI’s models[cite: 44]. While powerful, we hit credit limits, which pushed us to find a more sustainable and independent solution.
* **Phase 2 (Migration to Llama):** We successfully migrated to the **open-source Llama model**. This shift gave us full control over the system, increased efficiency, and proved that cutting-edge AI can run on local infrastructure without depending on third-party paid APIs.

## ✨ What Makes This Project Unique?
[cite_start]Unlike typical "black box" chatbots, Mindreader.ai visualizes its internal "thinking" process in real-time[cite: 17, 32]:
* **Live Data Flow Visualization:** A unique module that reveals the invisible. [cite_start]You can see the exact journey of your input—from the frontend to the backend, through the logic engine, and into the AI model for probability recalculation[cite: 25, 27, 29].
* [cite_start]**Reasoning Panel:** A secondary display shows how the system statistically narrows down millions of possibilities, visually eliminating incorrect options until only the winner remains[cite: 17, 18, 21].
* [cite_start]**Confidence Meter:** Watch the system’s confidence score grow in real-time with every answer you provide[cite: 16, 20, 38].

## 🎓 Educational Objectives
[cite_start]Designed for a 14+ audience, the project aims to teach that[cite: 9, 35]:
* [cite_start]AI works through **probability**, not magic[cite: 36].
* [cite_start]Systems eliminate options using **structured attributes** and logic[cite: 37, 39].
* [cite_start]Confidence increases as uncertainty in data decreases[cite: 38].
* [cite_start]AI systems are essentially **pipelines of structured data transformations**[cite: 32].

## 🛠 Technical Approach
[cite_start]We implemented a **hybrid strategy** that combines the flexibility of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the precision of a structured logic engine[cite: 41, 42]:
1.  [cite_start]**LLM Engine (Llama):** Dynamically generates questions to narrow down possibilities as efficiently as possible[cite: 43, 44].
2.  [cite_start]**Logic Engine:** Ensures stability and provides the data needed for real-time visualization, making the process understandable for the user[cite: 55, 67].

[cite_start]*This project was developed as part of the **Hackathon Fontys Openlearning** to demonstrate that the world of ICT is creative, transparent, and accessible to everyone with a curious mind[cite: 78, 79].*
